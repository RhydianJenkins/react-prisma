## What's preconfigured?

The intent of this starter is to be really slim so it's not a nightmare to remove or change stuff, that's why there are just a few things preconfigured:

- TypeScript
- MongoDB
- Express server
- ESLint
- Prettier
- A few yarn scripts
- Some folder structure

## Scripts

- `yarn dev`. Runs the project in dev mode, which means that it won't check types and will restart with every change you make.
- `yarn build`. Compiles the project.
- `yarn start`. Runs the compiled program. Remember to execute `yarn build` before attempting to launch the program.
- `yarn typecheck`. Checks the typings of the project. Gets executed before trying to create a new commit but you can also run it manually.
- `yarn format`. Runs Prettier. Format all documents.
- `yarn lint`. Runs ESLint. You can append `--fix` in order to fix autofixable issues.
